      <p>4. Read the following passage carefully and answer all the questions which follow
      
                                          <p>The dry season was very long. The people waited anxiously for the rains to plant their seeds. The rain clouds that appeared occasionally were deceptive. To while away the time, they wove baskets and kente; others carved stools or sat under trees, playing games and drinking palm wine.
      
                                          <p>Sentu and his family were on the verge of starvation. They had just one cassava farm left to feed on. The maize in the barn was all gone. In fact, they had started eating the seed maize. Sentu kept wondering how he would get seeds to plant when the rainy season eventually started. He went to inspect the traps he had set for the rodents that had been feasting on the cassava. If the traps caught any animals, it would be a double blessing; he would get meat and reduce the population of ‘his enemies’, the pests. While inspecting his traps, he saw some smoke. He dashed towards it. He tried to put out the fire but could not. He shouted for help. In a twinkling of an eye, the whole farm had been destroyed. Sentu wept uncontrollably.
      
                                          <p>When he reached the village, his neighbours rushed to his house to console him. They gave him foodstuff and promised to help him get back on his feet. Tutu, the palm-wine tapper, visited Sentu that evening. He was accompanied by two elderly and highly respected men in the village. Their task was simple. Tutu had asked them to apologise to Sentu on his behalf. It was the fire from Tutu’s torch that had caused the havoc and brought such agony to Sentu’s family. What could Sentu do or say?
